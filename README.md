**Project Title: Automated Azure WebApp Deployment with CI/CD Pipelines**

**Project Goals:**
The goal of this project is to create an end-to-end automated deployment process for a web application using Azure DevOps. The process will involve setting up Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines that will automatically deploy the application through QA, Automation Testing, and Production stages. The project will utilize Azure WebApp for hosting the application, GitHub for version control, Maven for building the application, Azure Repos for code repository management, Selenium for automated testing, and Azure DevOps for managing the CI/CD pipelines.

**Project Process and Details:**

**Code Repository Setup:**

Create a GitHub repository to host the web application's source code.
Develop the web application using Java and any required frameworks.
Azure DevOps Setup:

Create a new project in Azure DevOps.
Set up Azure Repos to synchronize with the GitHub repository.
CI/CD Pipeline Setup:

**Configure a Continuous Integration pipeline:**

Set up triggers to automatically initiate the pipeline when code changes are pushed to the repository.
Use Maven to build the application and generate an artifact.
Store the artifact in Azure DevOps artifacts repository.
Configure a Continuous Deployment pipeline for QA environment:

Use Azure WebApp service to host the application in the QA environment.
Set up the deployment pipeline to deploy the artifact to the QA environment.
Trigger automated tests using Selenium for basic functionality verification.
Configure an Automation Testing pipeline:

Set up a separate environment for automated testing.
Use Selenium to execute more extensive tests on the application.
Integrate the pipeline with the automated tests, triggering them upon deployment.
Configure a Continuous Deployment pipeline for Production environment:

Similar to the QA deployment pipeline, deploy the application to the production environment.
Implement necessary approvals or gates before deploying to the production environment.
Docker Integration:

If desired, integrate Docker into the CI/CD pipeline for containerization.
Create Docker images for the application and use them in the deployment stages.
Project Boards and Tracking:

Utilize Azure DevOps project boards or task management tools to track the progress of tasks, features, and bug fixes.
**Skills and Tools:**

AzureWebApp: For hosting the web application.
Java: Programming language for developing the web application.
GitHub: Version control and collaboration platform.
Maven: Build tool for compiling and packaging the application.
Azure Repos: Code repository management within Azure DevOps.
Selenium: Automated testing framework for web applications.
Azure DevOps: Platform for managing the CI/CD pipelines, repositories, and project boards.


By completing this project, you will demonstrate your proficiency in setting up an automated deployment pipeline using Azure DevOps, integrating different tools and technologies to achieve a smooth CI/CD process. This project also showcases your ability to manage and track development tasks and testing using project boards and other collaboration tools within Azure DevOps.
